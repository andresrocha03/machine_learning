# Regression
Here are some references I used to learn more about regression:

### StatQuest
Explains the basics statistics behind the regression in an easy and comprehensible way.You can see the video in this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer).


### Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow 
This is a great book of introduction to machine-learning concepts. It offers a complete view of several important contents. The chapter 4 explains linear regression, polynomial regression, logistic regression and other important topics. You can read the chapter 4 in this [link](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/ch04.html).
